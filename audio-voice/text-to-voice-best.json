Today we explore the advanced capabilities of modern text-to-speech technology with seamless character and language switching.\n\n[Narrator] In a bustling international café, conversations flow between languages and voices.[pause:2s] Let me tell you about what happened yesterday.\n\n[crestfallen_original] I was sitting at my usual table when I overheard [Alice] Guten Morgen! Wie geht es Ihnen heute? [crestfallen_original] The German woman's voice was so pleasant that [Bob] Hei! Hvordan har du det i dag? [crestfallen_original] Even the Norwegian gentleman couldn't help but join the conversation.\n\n[pause:1.5s][Alice] It's fascinating how [en:Alice] we can switch between languages so naturally, [de:Alice] aber manchmal ist es schwierig [en:Alice] to find the right words in each language.\n\n[crestfallen_original] The conversation continued as [Girl] Oh, I completely understand! [crestfallen_original] said a young woman nearby, [Girl] Sometimes I think in English but [de:Girl] meine Träume sind auf Deutsch [Girl] and it gets quite confusing!\n\n[pause:2s][Cowboy] Well partner, [crestfallen_original] interrupted a distinctive voice from the corner, [Cowboy] back in my day we had to learn languages the hard way. [crestfallen_original] The man's weathered face told stories of [Cowboy] countless adventures across different lands and cultures.\n\n[Bob] Det er veldig interessant! [crestfallen_original] he replied thoughtfully, [no:Bob] Men nå med moderne teknologi [en:Bob] we can preserve and share these voices across the world.\n\n[pause:1s][Old Man] You know, [crestfallen_original] began an elderly gentleman, [Old Man] I've lived through the transition from [no:Old Man] når vi bare hadde radio [en:Old Man] to this incredible digital age where [Old Man] voices can be recreated and shared instantly.\n\n[Alice] Das stimmt! [crestfallen_original] Alice nodded enthusiastically, [de:Alice] Meine Großmutter würde das nicht glauben [en:Alice] if she could see how we communicate today. [Alice] The technology bridges generations and cultures.\n\n[pause:2.5s][crestfallen_original] As the afternoon progressed, the conversation became even more animated. [Girl] Did you hear about the new developments? [crestfallen_original] she asked excitedly, [Girl] They say we can now capture the essence of any voice and [Girl] make it speak in multiple languages perfectly!\n\n[Cowboy] That's mighty impressive, [crestfallen_original] the cowboy drawled, [Cowboy] reminds me of those old radio shows where [Cowboy] one person would voice multiple characters. [crestfallen_original] His eyes twinkled with nostalgia.\n\n[pause:1s][Bob] Nøyaktig! [crestfallen_original] Bob agreed, [no:Bob] Det er som å ha et teaterensemble [en:Bob] right in your pocket. [Bob] The possibilities for storytelling are endless.\n\n[no:Alice] Det er utrolig! [crestfallen_original] Alice switched to Norwegian, [no:Alice] Vi kan nå fortelle historier på så mange måter [en:Alice] and reach audiences we never imagined before.\n\n[pause:3s][Narrator] The café slowly emptied as evening approached, but the conversation had sparked something special. [crestfallen_original] Each person left with [Old Man] a new appreciation for how technology [crestfallen_original] was preserving and expanding [Girl] the beautiful diversity of human speech [crestfallen_original] while bringing people together across linguistic barriers.\n\n[Cowboy] Until we meet again, partners, [crestfallen_original] the cowboy tipped his hat, [Cowboy] remember that every voice tells a story worth hearing.\n\n[pause:1.5s][Alice] Auf Wiedersehen! [Bob] Ha det bra! [Girl] See you all soon! [Old Man] Take care everyone! [crestfallen_original] And with that, the multicultural symphony of voices faded into the evening air.\n\n[pause:2s][Narrator] This is the power of modern voice technology. [pause:1s] Not just converting text to speech, but preserving the rich tapestry of human expression across languages, cultures, and generations. [pause:1s] Every voice matters, every language counts, and every story deserves to be heard.\n\n[pause:3s][crestfallen_original] The future of communication is here, and it speaks with the voices of humanity itself."]},{"id":46,"type":"ChatterBoxEngineNode","pos":[-1756.132418471199,2594.9038423442958],"size":[349.4452838824459,252.77203188936073],"flags":{},"order":13,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"language","name":"language","type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"language"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"device","name":"device","type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"device"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"exaggeration","name":"exaggeration","type":"FLOAT","widget":{"name":"exaggeration"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"temperature","name":"temperature","type":"FLOAT","widget":{"name":"temperature"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"cfg_weight","name":"cfg_weight","type":"FLOAT","widget":{"name":"cfg_weight"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"crash_protection_template","name":"crash_protection_template","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"crash_protection_template"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"TTS_engine","name":"TTS_engine","type":"TTS_ENGINE","links":[101]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"tts_audio_suite","ver":"ee95cad1f155eceb1442723c7f351949b30361e3","Node name for S&R":"ChatterBoxEngineNode"},"widgets_values":["English","auto",0.65,0.6,0.4,""],"color":"#222","bgcolor":"#000"},{"id":50,"type":"PreviewAny","pos":[-196.91919296803508,2190.891995911058],"size":[561.1266880383131,311.05070141498845],"flags":{},"order":27,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"source","name":"source","type":"*","link":100}],"outputs":[],"properties":{"cnr_id":"comfy-core","ver":"0.3.57","Node name for S&R":"PreviewAny"},"widgets_values":[null,null,null]},{"id":47,"type":"UnifiedTTSTextNode","pos":[-657.041015625,1982.4339599609375],"size":[400,324],"flags":{},"order":24,"mode":0,"inputs":[{"localized_name":"TTS_engine","name":"TTS_engine","type":"TTS_ENGINE","link":102},{"localized_name":"opt_narrator","name":"opt_narrator","shape":7,"type":"*","link":122},{"localized_name":"text","name":"text","type":"STRING","widget":{"name":"text"},"link":108},{"localized_name":"narrator_voice","name":"narrator_voice","type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"narrator_voice"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"seed","name":"seed","type":"INT","widget":{"name":"seed"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"enable_chunking","name":"enable_chunking","shape":7,"type":"BOOLEAN","widget":{"name":"enable_chunking"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"max_chars_per_chunk","name":"max_chars_per_chunk","shape":7,"type":"INT","widget":{"name":"max_chars_per_chunk"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"chunk_combination_method","name":"chunk_combination_method","shape":7,"type":"COMBO","widget":{"name":"chunk_combination_method"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"silence_between_chunks_ms","name":"silence_between_chunks_ms","shape":7,"type":"INT","widget":{"name":"silence_between_chunks_ms"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"enable_audio_cache","name":"enable_audio_cache","shape":7,"type":"BOOLEAN","widget":{"name":"enable_audio_cache"},"link":null},{"localized_name":"batch_size","name":"batch_size","shape":7,"type":"INT","widget":{"name":"batch_size"},"link":null}],"outputs":[{"localized_name":"audio","name":"audio","type":"AUDIO","links":[93,123]},{"localized_name":"generation_info","name":"generation_info","type":"STRING","links":[100]}],"properties":{"cnr_id":"tts_audio_suite","ver":"ee95cad1f155eceb1442723c7f351949b30361e3","Node name for S&R":"UnifiedTTSTextNode"},"widgets_values":["Hello!
